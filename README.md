# DataAnalystReport_HousePricePrediction
This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.

The background : Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably wonâ€™t begin with the height of the
basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this dataset proves that much more influences
price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

The goal : With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, we want
to predict the final price of each home.

In this analysis, compare different regression models in predicting the house price and present a great
prediction performance using stacking model along with an awesome interpretation using SHAP. The XGboost
model shows that the gross area, the overall material used, the total square feet of basement area are the
most important features that influence the house price.
